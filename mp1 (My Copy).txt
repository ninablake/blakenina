<p>Hi my name is Nina Vuillemot. I am an 8th grade math teacher at Shelby Middle School. I am  
currently working on getting my Master in Instructional Technology and will be halfway through my degree after this semester. I am currently in my 2nd full year of teaching and will be coaching girls middle school track this year.This is also my first time using HTML but I am really enjoying learning all the features by trial and error. I always thought coding would be extremely difficult but it seems to be pretty easy so far. </p> <img>
